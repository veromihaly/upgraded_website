                I'm a recent graduate from the University of Debrecen, Faculty of Informatics. My final project was a 3D survival RPG game built in Unity, where I explored AI, animations, sound design, and more. 
                I hold certifications in Python (IT Specialist), HTML and CSS (IT Specialist), and Unity (Certified User: Programmer). I have strong skills in C#, Unity, and web technologies, and I love taking on challenges that stretch my problem-solving and creativity.
                I thrive in both team environments and independent projects, and Iâ€™m currently open to opportunities in software development, especially in game dev, frontend, or full-stack roles.
                In my free time, I enjoy gaming, drawing, and watching English-language series and films.
